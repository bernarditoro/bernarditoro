# About Me

I’m a software engineer focused on backend engineering and blockchain development. I build reliable backend systems for smooth user experiences and have experience in blockchain development, specifically in decentralised finance (DeFi) where I design and implement solutions to complex problems. I work on smart contracts, and dApps and integrating blockchain into real-world applications. I also have experience in server administration and cloud deployment so the solutions I build are not only functional but also scalable. I work mainly with Python, and Solidity, and have experience with Django and Foundry frameworks.


# Growth and Collaboration

I enjoy collaborating with teams to turn ideas into impactful results and continually seek opportunities to refine my approach, streamline processes, and deliver high-quality solutions. Whether it’s learning a new technology or tackling a challenging problem, I’m always ready to grow and make a difference.
